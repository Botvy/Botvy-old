# Botvy

## About the project

Botvy is a chatbot for various live streaming platforms.

Botvy should be fully customizable for the broadcasters, so it doesn't come with predefined plugins.

The base only includes the following things:

-   base view for the chat (list of chat messages, viewer list, and an input for sending chat messages)
-   settings page (for opening the Chrome developer tools)
